    <p>  Welcome to this amazingly terrible webpage! It captivates a lot of my ugly interests ...IT'S SO COLORFUL YOU MIGHT THROW UP!! </p>
    <p>Scroll down to watch a short clip from "Jurrasic world," one of my favorite movies. A new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, creates a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex, which escapes containment and goes on a killing spree. "THAT'S RIGHT MATE!" </p>
    <p>So if you love this movie as much as I do then you will probably enjoy this scene where Dinosaurs now live--and hunt-- all over the world!</p>
